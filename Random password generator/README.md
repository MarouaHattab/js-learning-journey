## 💡 What I Learned

- JavaScript function parameters and return values
- String manipulation and concatenation
- Math.random() for cryptographic randomness
- DOM manipulation and event handling
- Form validation and error handling
- CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts
- Modern CSS features (backdrop-filter, custom properties)
- Responsive web design principles
- Clipboard API for copy functionality

## 🔧 Core Algorithm

The password generation uses a character pool approach:

1. Build allowed character sets based on user selection
2. Validate input parameters (length > 0, at least one character type)
3. Use Math.random() to select random characters from the pool
4. Assemble final password string
